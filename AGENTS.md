# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

Hexmeld is a turn-based puzzle game played on a hexagonal grid. It is designed as a web app that can be played offline and with no external dependencies.

## Development

- This game has some features to optimize it for use as a progressive web app, but the actual game should always remain functional offline, without dependencies, using just the index.html file in a modern web browser, even if some things don't work like the instructions.
- Whenever you make changes to this repository, increment the `GAME_VERSION` constant in `index.html` so the displayed version is updated.
- Game should stay fairly simple and easy to maintain.

- Keep these instructions in mind for future updates as well.
