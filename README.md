# Hexmeld

A turn-based puzzle game played on a hexagonal grid. Connect 6 or more balls of the same color to clear them and score points. Keep the board from filling up for as long as you can.

## How to Play

1. Click a colored ball to select it
2. Click an empty cell to move the ball there (must be a valid path)
3. Form groups of 6+ connected same-colored balls to clear them and score
4. If you don't clear a group, 3 new balls spawn (shown in the preview)
5. Game ends when the board fills completely

Score scales with group size: 6 balls = 6 points, 7 = 8 points, 8 = 11 points, etc.
